<h1>Welcome to Attorney Online!</h1>
<p>
Attorney Online is a fan-made game for roleplaying and doing Ace Attorney-style cases in an off-the-cuff 
format.
</p>
<p>
There are a variety of active servers in AO with their own communities. Please be sure to follow their 
rules, and, if applicable, download their base packs, which may be found in each server's description.
</p>
<p>
You will be downloading the <strong>Vanilla</strong> base pack, which is the classic set of characters 
that has not changed since the old 1.7.5 days. This is a very minimal set (~250 MB); however, some servers 
may require content packs of up to 7 GB in size. If disk space is a concern, we invite you to use 
<a href="http://web.aceattorneyonline.com/">webAO</a> to join these particular servers.
</p>
<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<p>
Attorney Online is a fan-made game and uses Capcom assets without prior authorization from Capcom, 
although the assets are used in such a way that promotes the Ace Attorney franchise.
</p>
<p>
In addition, some servers may offer custom content; these assets remain the property of their 
respective copyright holders.
</p>
<p>
When you join a server, your hard drive's ID may be stored by the server as a countermeasure 
for ban evasion. In-character and out-of-character chat may also be logged for moderation purposes. 
Please contact the server's admin for further inquiries about privacy.
